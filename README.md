# SelfDrivingSim
This is a driving simulator intended for training self-driving cars. I'm working on it for a science fair.

It has been used to train end-to-end convolutional neural networks (in SelfDrivingNetwork), sliding window systems (LaneDetection), and stop sign object detectors (StopSignFinder).
